>## PHP APP SHELL!
> PHP Single user, single page AJAX app shell (With Persona Auth integrated) (Back-end / front-end)
>
> I made this for a project I'm working on and I thought it would be nice to share it so it maybe helpful to others.
> Although it's completely functional and everything is massively tested (everything you expect from a shell) but I guess with no documentation, it is not so easy to employ it in a project (although certainly easier than re-doing everything), so I'll try to make a clear documentation to make it easier for ppl to re-use it in first chance, also I'll update the functionality and futures, so consider it version 0.01 ! but right now I don't have enough time, so accept my apology, m, ;)
> - for session and NONCE managments I used another PHP library of mine: [mimses (minimal session and Nonce manager for PHP)](https://github.com/mim-Armand/mimses)
